<h1>School Pollution Map</h1>

<h2> What is the data gap? </h2> Unfortunately, pollution measurements in Catalonia are surprisingly underexplored. There are very few measuring stations in the territory, and many of them do not measure particles in the air.

<h2> What does science tell us about air pollution? </h2> More and more research is telling us that airborne particles (PM10 and PM2.5) are very harmful to health. Studies show that these airborne particles can affect fetal health during pregnancy, our ability to concentrate, and increase the possibility of developing Alzheimer's or other neurological diseases, among other potential negative effects.

<h2>Why don't we have more reliable pollution measures?</h2> There are many factors working against pollution measurement initiatives. Until recently, particle measuring equipment was expensive - only recently has it become more affordable. Additionally, meters will most likely tell us that we are often above the levels recommended by the WHO. Therefore, there is limited interest in measuring it properly. Using newly-developed inexpensive meters will allow us to do this from the bottom-up!

<h2>What good is knowing what we breathe?</h2> The information in these sensors will help us better understand the health risks posed to each school. This information will be useful both for the students and for all the local residents. It will allow us to design protective actions for the most affected centers and alert us during high risk episodes. It will also allow us to provide data to governmental administrations, helping them to make more informed policy decisions. Our goal is to cover the whole territory in order to have a much more accurate map of pollution in Catalonia.

<h2>And at the educational level?</h2> We are talking about the science of sensors, pollution problems and health impacts, difficulties in how to improve air pollution, data analysis, and educational topics. This project can help teachers create very interesting interdisciplinary projects and activities in the classroom. For those schools currently using or thinking about using bike-buses, we are certain that these meters will demonstrate their positive environmental effects.

<h2>Our commitment.</h2> We are committed to devoting all resources to obtaining PM2.5 particle sensors (at a cost of approximately 250 euros per school). We are also committed to ensuring that these sensors are successfully installed at school or in nearby alternative locations (in local neighborhoods). Through sensors and measurements, we hope to run many educational events and outreach projects. The data will be publicly accessible to anyone who should want it. The first installations will begin in early September with the aim of quickly "mapping" the region.

<b>If you decide to make a contribution, we would appreciate it if you could include the population/school of origin to better understand the geographical interest in this project.</b>

<b>If you have a special interest in receiving the sensor at your school as soon as possible, please feel free to contact us. </b>
