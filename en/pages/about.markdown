Hello! This is a test site designed to practice combining themes and implementing multilingual settings. Apologies for the bad Catalan, I just used google translate.

This site was created with the [Lanyon theme](https://github.com/poole/lanyon) and methods adapted from [this blog post](https://forestry.io/blog/creating-a-multilingual-blog-with-jekyll/) by DJ Walker.

Enjoy your stay!
