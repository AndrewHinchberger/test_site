- improve footer
- improve home pages
- improve landing page
- use something other than a default lanyon theme? might be a bit of a pain but could be worth for final product
- multilingual title/tagline/desc are done by redirecting from config into code that we will have to manually replace instead of just editing the config info - is this ok?
- maybe condense 'lang-ref' and 'sidebar'?
- sidebar dropdowns (defn "subpage" layout w/ "parent" frontmatter?) https://idratherbewriting.com/jekylldoctheme-separate-outputs/mydoc/mydoc_configure_sidebar.html ?
- push to github/host on github pages
